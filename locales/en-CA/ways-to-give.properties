bitcoin_info=The Mozilla Foundation is a California non-profit corporation exempt from United States federal income taxation under IRC 501(c)(3) and a public charity classified under IRC sections 170(b)(1)(A) and 509(a)(1). Bitcoin donations Mozilla receives are considered charitable contributions under U.S. federal tax laws, to be used in its discretion for its charitable purposes. Because the IRS has indicated that it will treat bitcoin as property for U.S. tax purposes (see IRS Notice 2014-21), donations of bitcoin may be subject to special rules as to the amount of your charitable deduction, the documentation that must be provided to claim a tax deduction, or other matters.
